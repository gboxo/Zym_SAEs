# Visualize protein regions with highest KL divergence between 2 models




To investigate what happens when we perfrom DPO on a model to increase Enzyme activity, we will collect the KL divergence between 2 models; The base ZymCTRL and the DPO model at the last ieration.




We will collect the KL divergece in 4 sets of data (starting with one):
    - Natural Alpha Amylases (we will start here)
    - Alpha Amylases from the DMS
    - Alpha Amylases Generated by the base model
    - Alpha Amylases Generated by the DPO model



Once we've computed the LK divergence will inspect with pymol.


If there's something interesting, we migh then try to correlated the KL divergence with some secondary structures atuomatically.
